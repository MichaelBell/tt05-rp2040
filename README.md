# Tiny Tapeout 05 tetris

This firmware provides the necessary memory interface to allow the Tetris project on TT05 to work.

See the Raspberry Pi [Getting Started with Pico](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/pico/getting-started-with-pico.pdf) guide for information on how to get set up to build the firmware.

Note you must build in Release mode.

This project overclocks the RP2040 to 300MHz and overvolts it to 1.2V (0.1V above stock) to ensure that is stable.  This may void your warranty, use at your own risk.
